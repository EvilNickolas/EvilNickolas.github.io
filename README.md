GitHub Pages Site for my personal *extended* resume - The idea is to include extra information about my work or projects that may be interesting to perspective employers but not something id put on a regular resume. Also serves as an example my ability to create content for the Web.

Theme Samples from https://pages-themes.github.io/midnight/ where used while experimenting with this page.
